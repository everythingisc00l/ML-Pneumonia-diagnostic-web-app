This is the repository for my flask-based web app for diagnostic pneumonia or normal from DICOM medical pictures (currently png/jpg version).

*This model based on ResNet-50. Accuracy on test **98%**.*

# Next steps:

1. Creating heat maps.
2. Connecting database for keep statistics from medics.
3. Integrating to medical services and train with human feedback on new data.

# Quick start for Windows

With ai_kt.bat start app file.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open copied folder and find ai_kt.bat file, then open with any text editor.
3. Change path in folder to "X:<YOUR_PATH_TO_THIS_FOLDER>\" then save it and close.
4. You can test this model with images in **test_images** folder
   
Run this file and waiting for start in your browser on localhost.
